# DDID - DUAL DIFFUSION IMPLICIT BRIDGES FOR IMAGE-TO-IMAGE TRANSLATION

Replication on experiments on synthetic data.

Diffusion models (ddpm) trained on synthetic datasets independently can be used to solve data-to-data translation with verifiable consistency and connection to shrodinger bridges. Here you can find code for data generation, training, sampling and visualizations in notebook
